# Water-Quality-EDA-and-Prediction
---
## Overview
This repository showcases a data science project focused on analyzing and predicting water potability.

## Dataset
The dataset used in these projects, `water_potability.csv`, includes measurements of different water quality metrics for 3276 different water bodies. Key features include pH value, hardness, solids (TDS), chloramines, sulfate, conductivity, organic carbon, trihalomethanes, turbidity, and a binary potability indicator.
Dataset was take from [Kaggle]([url](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability))

## Project
 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Detailed examination of the 'water_potability' dataset to uncover insights about water quality metrics.
 - Data Preprocessing: Techniques like handling missing values, feature scaling, and addressing class imbalance (using SMOTE) are implemented to prepare the data for modeling.
- Model Development and Comparison: Utilizing scikit-learn, several machine learning models are trained and evaluated to predict water potability. 

Libraries Used: Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, imbalanced-learn.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- [Other necessary software/libraries]
