# Water-Quality-EDA-and-Prediction
Creating a well-structured and informative README file is crucial for effectively presenting your project on GitHub. Below is a template for your `README.md` file for the "Water-Quality-Analysis-and-Prediction" repository. You can customize this template as needed to fit the specifics of your project.

---
## Overview
This repository contains two interrelated projects focusing on the analysis and prediction of water quality using a dataset of various water bodies. The first project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights from the dataset, while the second project develops a machine learning model to predict water potability based on various quality parameters.

## Dataset
The dataset used in these projects, `water_potability.csv`, includes measurements of different water quality metrics for 3276 different water bodies. Key features include pH value, hardness, solids (TDS), chloramines, sulfate, conductivity, organic carbon, trihalomethanes, turbidity, and a binary potability indicator.

## Projects

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA project aims to understand the distributions, correlations, and patterns within the water quality data. Key findings and visualizations from this analysis are presented in `EDA.ipynb`.

### 2. Water Quality Prediction Model
This project involves building and evaluating a machine learning model to predict the potability of water. The model, its performance, and the evaluation process are detailed in `Modeling.ipynb`.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- [Other necessary software/libraries]
